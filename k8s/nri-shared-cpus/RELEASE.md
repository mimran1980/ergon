# Release gate

`ergon-shared-cpus` is **not released**. Nothing is on a registry. The chart,
the Dockerfile and the workflow in this tree are ready to publish; the items
below are not.

The first push to `ghcr.io/mimran1980/ergon-shared-cpus` happens only when
every row is signed off. Until then the workflow builds and uploads an image
tarball as an artifact and writes nothing to a registry.

## 1. Code defects

These were known and open. All four are fixed; each one could put a container
on the wrong CPUs or
refuse one it should take.

| # | defect | where | state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `NicNumaNode` defaults to `0` | `internal/config/config.go` | **fixed.** `Parse()` sets `-1` (unknown). Four tests in `config_numa_test.go`: `TestParseNicNumaNodeUnknown`, `TestNicNumaNodeUnknownRefusesOnMultiNode`, `TestNicNumaNodeUnknownStillAnswersOnOneNode`, `TestNicNumaNodeKnownAnswersItsNode`. Before: `NicNumaNode = 0, want -1`, and `PickMems("", [0 1], 0) = "0"` (silent node 0). After: all pass |
| 2 | `CheckCoreLayout` only tests an exclusive CPU's siblings against the shared set | `internal/cpuset/cpuset.go` | **fixed.** Also refuses when a core's siblings sit outside exclusive ∪ shared, naming the unmanaged CPU. Doc comment says only exclusive cores are held to this: a shared core with an unmanaged sibling is fine. Tests `TestCheckCoreLayout` (3 new cases), `TestCheckCoreLayoutNamesTheUnmanagedSibling`, `TestCheckCoreLayoutLeavesSharedAlone` |
| 3 | `UpdateContainer` does not reconcile partition/reservation, and `Synchronize` can replay a stale widen | `internal/nriplugin/plugin.go` | **fixed.** Three things: the reservation now follows the container (`hold` on a managed update, `release` when it stops being an exclusive integer-CPU container, `holdPresent` when its shared set is outside today's `sharedCpus`); a resize that makes the `cpu-partition` hooks stale is reported (`stale_partition`), because NRI cannot re-run a createRuntime hook; and the delayed re-widen copy is dropped for a container that has since been updated, stopped or removed (`touched` / `markTouched`). Five tests: `TestUpdateIneligibleReleasesTheReservation`, `TestUpdateRewidenKeepsTheReservation`, `TestUpdateResizeReportsStalePartition`, `TestSynchronizeResendIsNotReplayedAfterUpdate`, `TestSynchronizeResendIsNotReplayedAfterStop` |
| 4 | DaemonSet does not mount the host cgroup tree | `deploy/daemonset.yaml`, `charts/.../templates/daemonset.yaml` | **fixed.** Host cgroup v2 mounted read-only at `/sys/fs/cgroup` (the node's own path, which `config.cgroupRoot` and the createRuntime hook both name). Read-only because the plugin never writes the host tree from inside the pod: the `cpu-partition` writes are `ergon-cpus`'s, and runc runs that hook on the node. Same mount in both manifests; `helm lint` and `helm template` pass |

Sign-off: each defect has a failing test first, then a fix, then the cgroup
kernel lane (`scripts/check-cgroup.sh`) and the kind e2e (`test/e2e.sh`)
green. All four have their unit evidence. On 2026-10-18 the whole tree passed
`scripts/check.sh` (gofmt, vet, `go test -race`, static amd64 and arm64, then
the cgroup kernel lane) and `test/e2e.sh` (18 steps, `fails: 0`, teardown
left no cluster, container, image or volume this run created).

Two test fixtures were wrong rather than the product, and are worth knowing
about. Defect 2's core-layout rule now refuses an exclusive core whose other
SMT thread is unmanaged, which is the rule working: `TestBalanceOverSharedCPUs`
put three containers on CPUs 2, 3 and 6 and so split the cores 2,6 and 3,7
across containers, and `TestCreateCpuPartitionWithoutSharedOptIn` asked for
2,3 with their siblings 6,7 unmanaged. Both now take whole cores. Separately,
the defect-3 tests called `UpdateContainer` on the create *request* rather
than the live container; `applyAdjustment` folds the create adjustment in the
way the runtime does, so the update sees the widened cpuset and the
`ERGON_ISOLATED_CGROUP` env.

## 2. Test coverage

| lane | command | state |
|---|---|---|
| unit, vet, static amd64+arm64 | `scripts/check.sh --local` | green 2026-10-18 over the whole tree |
| cgroup kernel lane (real cgroup v2, partition a real kernel will accept) | `scripts/check-cgroup.sh` | green 2026-10-18 over the whole tree |
| kind e2e, 18 steps | `test/e2e.sh` | green 2026-10-18, `fails: 0` |
| EKS | — | **not verified.** The NRI socket, nodeadm TOML merge, `/opt` writable and `system-node-critical` outside `kube-system` are all unproven on a real node |
| AKS | — | not supported (no NRI enablement, no `reservedSystemCPUs`) |
| CRI-O | — | not supported; use its own `shared_cpuset` |
| Bottlerocket | — | not verified. runc exec of a hook binary from a pod-written host path is unproven on a read-only root with SELinux |

## 3. Benchmarks

The README lists what is **not measured**. Every one of these is a release
blocker, because the claim of this plugin is that the exclusive CPUs stay
quiet. A figure without its max is not a result.

| claim | what must be measured | state |
|---|---|---|
| helpers on shared CPUs do not disturb the hot thread | hot-thread latency p50 / p90 / p99 / p99.9 / p99.99 / **max** with and without the plugin, same load, same host | not measured |
| a wake-up on a shared CPU can wait milliseconds under node load | distribution of that wait under a load the node is meant to carry | not measured |
| the CPU env and the pin do not cost the hot path | cost of `pin_isolated` and of reading `ERGON_*` | not measured |
| capacity accounting is honest | scheduler sees `len(sharedCpus) x 1000 x oversubscription`, and a pod that asks for more is refused | covered by unit tests, not measured |
| the layout refusal fires | a split core is named and refused, with the core id | covered by unit tests, not measured on hardware |

"Covered by all scenarios" means: a split core, an unknown NUMA node, a
missing `thread_siblings_list`, an incomplete topology, a kubelet restart
with the plugin up and with it down, a hand-set `ERGON_*` env, an ineligible
quota or shares, an in-place resize, an exec probe, a `cpu-partition`
opt-in on a kernel without `cpuset.cpus.exclusive`, and a pod outside the
namespace allowlist. Each has a test or a documented refusal.

## 4. Docs

| item | state |
|---|---|
| README status says "not released" and names this gate | done; must be rewritten the day of the first push |
| README `## Prior art` names CRI-O, `mixed-cpu-node-plugin`, `dra-driver-cpu` #103/#149/#305, `nri-plugins` and `nri-cpuset-partition`, and does not claim novelty | done |
| README `## Verify` includes the IRQ-leak check (probe and socket on one exclusive CPU) | done |
| book install runbook (`book/src/deploy/shared-cpus.md`) | present; must name the released image tag |
| contract (resource name, annotation keys, env names) | stated in the README; changes go in the repo `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `--version` prints version, git describe and NRI module version | done |

## 5. Claims

Nothing published may claim this idea is new. The README `## Prior art`
section is the standing wording; keep it in step with these projects:

| project | watch |
|---|---|
| [kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu) | [#103](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu/issues/103), [#149](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu/pull/149), [#305](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu/issues/305). When mixed allocation merges, this tree's reason to exist narrows to the containerd-now path and the quant-facing API |
| [cri-o/cri-o](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) | `shared_cpuset` is the production reference. Ours must not be described as more mature than it |
| [containers/nri-plugins](https://github.com/containers/nri-plugins) | the heavyweight alternative. Do not grow this tree towards it (IRQ, governors, pool trees) |

Do not claim SBE wire compatibility, latency numbers or "loss-free" in this
tree without a measured `BENCHMARKS.md` beside this file. Unmeasured is
written "not measured", never invented.

## 6. How to publish, once the gate is clear

Nothing below has been run.

1. Fix the four defects and the test lanes in sections 1 and 2.
2. Run the benchmarks in section 3 and put the numbers in a
   `BENCHMARKS.md` next to this file, each latency with its max and each max
   traced to a cause.
3. Rewrite the README status paragraph and the book runbook to name the
   released tag.
4. Run `.github/workflows/nri-shared-cpus-publish.yml` with the tag you want
   and `publish: publish`. That one run pushes the multi-arch image and the
   chart. Its first step refuses to continue unless the input reads exactly
   `publish`, so a typo fails the run instead of quietly doing nothing. The
   build and the chart are proven by `.github/workflows/nri-shared-cpus-image.yml`,
   which pushes nothing; the publish workflow re-runs both before it pushes.
5. Verify the push: pull `ghcr.io/mimran1980/ergon-shared-cpus:<tag>` on
   both amd64 and arm64, run `--version`, and `helm install` the pushed
   chart on a test cluster.
